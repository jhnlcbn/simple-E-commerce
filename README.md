# simple-E-commerce

This is a simple E-commerce website developed using PHP and MySQL as part of my BSIT studies. The system includes basic features such as product listings, user registration and login, shopping cart functionality, and an admin dashboard for managing products and orders. It is designed to demonstrate how core PHP can be used to build a functional online store, with a focus on learning and practical application.
